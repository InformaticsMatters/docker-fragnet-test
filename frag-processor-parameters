# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# An example (template) for a set of parameters that can be used to
# drive the workflow engine for 'fragment' play. You can set any
# playbook parameter here that affects your job, only the essential ones
# are illustrated.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The playbook to run (DO NOT CHANGE).
# This must match the basename name of a playbook in our 'playbooks'
# directory. The value here must be 'fragment', as this is a set of
# parameters for the 'fragment.yaml' playbook.
play: fragment

# What to FRAGMENT...
#
# Here we need to define the identity (S3 path) of the 'standard' file,
# the vendor type and the identity (number) of the standard to fragment.
#
# Supported values for 'process_type' are: -
# - chemspace_bb
# - emolecules_bb
# - emolecules_plus
# - emolecules_sc
# - enamine
# - molport
# - senp7
process_id: vendor/molport/2019-08
process_type: molport
process_standard_number: 2

# Fragmentation control parameters,
# consisting of the shred, chink and molecule complexity filters.
process_gp_shred_size: 120
process_gp_chunk_size: 12
process_min_hac: 0
process_max_hac: 36
process_max_frag: 12

# The fragalysis code to use.
# The version must exist as a GitHub tag and as a tag on an
# exiting docker image.
fragalysis_version: 0.4.3

# Misc parameters
#
# We're fragmenting, so the nextflow workflow might take some time.
# Adjust the maximum execution time and poll period accordingly.
# If the fragment is going to take many hours
# then a 10 or 20 minute poll period shouldn't introduce a great deal
# of latency.
nextflow_timeout_minutes: 2880
nextflow_poll_period_minutes: 10
